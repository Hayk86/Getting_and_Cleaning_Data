Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec 
and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, 
was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals.
=========================================
In total there are 18  = 3 x 3 x 2 features in addition to specifiying the activity.

Those are:
- The sensor: Accelerometer and hyroscope, and gravity measure
- Dimensions in space: X, Y, and Z
- Summary measure: Mean and standard deviation (std)

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'run_analysis.R' : That processes the raw data and returns the tidy data including
